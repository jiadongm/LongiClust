\title{Generate Random Projections for Functional Data Clustering}
\usage{
generateRP(
  B,
  d0,
  r,
  basis = "bspline",
  grid = seq(0, 1, length.out = 100),
  bspline_degree = 3,
  bspline_knots = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{Integer. Number of random projections to generate}

\item{d0}{Integer. Dimension of multivariate functional data}

\item{r}{Integer. Number of basis functions to use for each projection}

\item{basis}{Character or matrix. Basis type to use:
\itemize{
  \item "bspline" - B-spline basis (default, recommended for omics data)
  \item "fourier" - Fourier basis
  \item matrix - Custom r x grid_length matrix of basis functions
}}

\item{grid}{Vector. Grid points where basis functions are evaluated}

\item{bspline_degree}{Integer. Degree of B-splines if basis = "bspline" (default 3)}

\item{bspline_knots}{Vector. Optional knot positions for B-splines. If NULL,
uses equally spaced internal knots. Knots should be in range of grid.}
}
\value{
List with B elements, each containing:
  \item{Psi}{List of d0 projection functions (each as coefficient vector)}
  \item{coefficients}{d0 x r matrix of normalized coefficients}
  \item{projection_id}{Integer identifying the projection}
}
\description{
Generate Random Projections for Functional Data Clustering
}
\details{
B-splines are the default and recommended basis for longitudinal omics data because:
\itemize{
  \item Local support: Each basis function is zero outside its support interval
  \item Feature selection: Projections can be zero-valued over certain intervals
  \item Flexibility: Can focus on specific time windows of biological interest
}

Custom knot placement allows you to concentrate basis functions in regions
where you expect important biological changes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate projections with B-spline basis (default)
projections <- generateRP(B = 100, d0 = 3, r = 10)

# B-spline with custom knot placement (focus on early time points)
grid <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
knots <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1)  # More knots early
projections <- generateRP(B = 100, d0 = 3, r = 10,
                         basis = "bspline", bspline_knots = knots, grid = grid)

# Fourier basis for periodic patterns
projections <- generateRP(B = 100, d0 = 3, r = 10, basis = "fourier")

# Custom basis
custom_basis <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 100), nrow = 10, ncol = 100)
projections <- generateRP(B = 100, d0 = 3, r = 10,
                         basis = custom_basis, grid = grid)
